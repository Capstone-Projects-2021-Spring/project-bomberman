# System Overview
 
Bomberman is a multiplayer desktop application that can be played with friends utilizing a game server. Maps can be custom made and loaded into the game and then be chosen to allow players a unique experience with each play.
Each user will make a connection to the game server. As they play, data from their actions will be sent to the server and interpreted in order to update the state of the game as a whole. Return packets will be processed on the client side in order to update the game status on the client machine. If time permits a database will be used to keep track of game history and other data. A form of storage will be used to keep all of the map files and any other assets.
